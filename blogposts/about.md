### My mission is to get you to read to the end of this post. ###

Which is in itself part of my larger mission to help you read more and read better.

So in short, that's what this site exists for - I want to provide resources to help you become a better reader. Those resources include blog posts, book reviews/recommendations and helpful quotes. As the site matures, so will these offerings.

But why? What's so great about reading?

Because __reading has become essential.__

Our lives have become fast-paced happy nightmares in the west. You often find yourself ruled by the tyranny of your efficiency or the tyranny of your laziness, depending on the day. I know I do. And both of these tyrants are commanding, pressuring you to do what you do quickly. Do you find yourself given over to "getting stuff done", or binging on Netflix? I bet both of those desires are at times all-consuming. During the day your enjoy yourself, but at the end of the day you look back and see either the time you wasted or the people you hurt by of your actions.

Well, reading can help with that. Reading can change your life.

Good reading gets you outside of yourself. It forces you to slow down a bit, and relaxes the grip of the tyrants over your life. Good reading metes out information at a slower pace than the screen does. And it provides a higher return-on-investment of your time and effort, creating in you a sense of accomplishment and bolstering your confidence. Good reading also involves a human element on an intimate level - when you read you are being led by another human, instead of being a slave to an impersonal list or an impersonal screen.

I could keep going on the benefits of reading, but like a good book I'll mete that information out over time and across the site.

Congratulations on making it this far in the post.
